FORTRAN code for inverting co-seismic surface deformation data (GPS, InSAR, etc.) for fault slip distribution.

Highlights:

(1) incorporating with layered crust structure

(2) arbitrarily curved fault geometry

(3) a-priori constraint on the variation range of rake angle

(4) optional smoothing constraint applied to slip or stress-drop

(5) fast optimization algorithm based on the steepest descent method
